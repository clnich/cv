    <h2>Jiu Jitsu Submissions That I Love</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_choke>Triangle</a></strong> I have long legs and so it's fun and people give them up really easily</li>
        <li><strong>Arm Bar</strong>: I used to not understand them, but now I am beginning to utilize them more</li>
        <li><strong>Omoplata</strong>: It is a very fancy looking move</li>
        <li><strong>Ezekiel Choke</strong>: It's just a very mean move</li>
        <li><strong>Peruvian Necktie</strong>: Once again, super fancy</li>
    </ul>
